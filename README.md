## Implementation Notes

This solution intentionally avoids using `.env` files as the exercise only requires calling a single API endpoint. The API key and base URL are hardcoded in the service layer for simplicity.

## Features

- Single API endpoint integration (most viewed articles)
- Master/detail view implementation
- Complete test coverage (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Responsive design with Material UI
- Terminal-friendly operation

## How to Run

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/newyorktimearticles.git
cd newyorktimearticles
npm install
```
````

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test           # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage   # Generate coverage report
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Key Implementation Details

1. **API Service**

   ```typescript
   // Hardcoded endpoint in src/services/api.ts
   const API_URL = 'https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/1.json?api-key=DEMO_KEY';
   ```

2. **Testing Approach**

   - Mocked API responses in tests
   - 85%+ test coverage
   - React Testing Library for component tests

3. **Terminal Operation**  
   All functionality can be controlled via CLI commands:

   ```bash
   # Run tests in watch mode
   npm run test:watch

   # Check code quality
   npm run lint
   ```
